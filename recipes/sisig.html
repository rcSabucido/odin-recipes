    <h3>A pinoy classic that transcends generations.</h3>
    <p>
        Pork sisig is a Filipino street food of chopped pig parts and chicken
        livers tossed with a spicy and sour dressing, is said to have originated
        in Pampanga, a province centrally located on the island of Luzon in the
        northern Philippines.

    <p>
        The word sisig stems from sisigan, an old Tagalog word that means "to make
        sour", and sisig was basically a simple salad made with green papaya or
        guava, salt, pepper, and garlic, tossed in a vinegar dressing.
