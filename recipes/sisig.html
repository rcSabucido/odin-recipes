    <h3>A pinoy classic that transcends generations.</h3>
    <p>
        Pork sisig is a Filipino street food of chopped pig parts and chicken
        livers tossed with a spicy and sour dressing, is said to have originated
        in Pampanga, a province centrally located on the island of Luzon in the
        northern Philippines.
    </p>
    <p>
        The word sisig stems from sisigan, an old Tagalog word that means "to make
        sour", and sisig was basically a simple salad made with green papaya or
        guava, salt, pepper, and garlic, tossed in a vinegar dressing.

      <li>1/4 pound (115g) chicken livers</li>  
      <li>2 pounds (905g) skinless, boneless pork shoulder, or pig ears, snout
        and/or jowl
      </li>
      <li>2 cups (475ml) plus 1 tablespoon (15ml) neutral oil, such as canola or
        vegetable oil, divided
      </li>
      <li>10 medium garlic cloves, minced</li>
      <li>1/2 medium red onion (about 4 ounces;115g), finely diced</li>
      <li>1/4 cup (60ml) soy sauce, preferably Filipino brands such as Silver Swan
        or Datu Puti
      </li>
      <li>3 tablespoons (45ml) calamansi juice</li>
      <li>2 bird's eye chiles, stemmed, seeded, and minced</li>
      <li>4 large eggs (7 ounces; 200g)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (1 ounce; 30g) mayonnaise</li>
      <li>1 scallion, ends trimmed and sliced thinly on a bias, for garnish</li>
      <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>      
      <li>Calamansi halves, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
     <li>If using chicken livers, place in a counter top blender and process until smooth. 
        Transfer puréed livers to a small bowl, cover, and refrigerate. </li>
     <li>If using pork shoulder, blot dry with paper towels, cut into 1/2-inch pieces, then proceed to Step 3. 
        If using pig ears, snout, and/or jowl, place pork in stockpot or Dutch oven, 
        cover with water and boil until tender, between 60 to 90 minutes. Using tongs, transfer pig ears, 
        snout, and/or jowl to a rimmed baking sheet and set aside until cool enough to handle. 
        Blot dry with paper towels and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, then proceed to Step 3. </li>
     <li>Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet lined with a double layer of paper towels. 
        In a wok, heat 2 cups (475ml) oil over medium-high heat until it registers 375°F (190°C) on an instant-read thermometer. 
        Working in 3 batches, carefully lower a third of the pork shoulder, pig ears, snout, 
        and/or jowl into the oil and fry until lightly browned all over, about 1 minute. 
        Using a slotted spoon or spider, transfer pork to prepared rack. 
        Return oil to 375°F (190°C) and repeat with remaining pork. Set aside. </li>
     <li>In a 12-inch cast iron skillet, heat remaining 1 tablespoon (15ml) oil over 
        medium-high heat until shimmering. Add garlic and onion and cook, stirring frequently, 
        until softened and golden brown in color, about 3 minutes. </li>
     <li>Add reserved fried pork, puréed chicken livers (if using), soy sauce, 
        calamansi juice, and chiles, and mix until well combined. </li>
     <li>Increase heat to high and bring to a boil. Break eggs directly into pan, 
        spacing them evenly around perimeter. Lower heat to maintain a simmer, cover,
         and cook, without stirring, until egg whites are opaque and yolks are 
         runny but turning yellow on the edges, about 3 minutes. </li>
     <li>Add mayonnaise and scallions and mix with pork and eggs until fully combined. 
        Serve immediately with cooked white rice and calamansi halves. </li>
    </ol>
