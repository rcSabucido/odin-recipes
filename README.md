# odin-recipes
In this project, I have built a basic recipe website for the purposes of completing a project that the curriculum "The Odin Project" has told me to do.
I added in three recipes consisting of my favourite foods to eat and have formatted them in a way that the Odin Project has told me to do.
I coded the website using HTML only but I am planning to add CSS and JS code in this project in the near future once I learn how to do so.
